Dragonfly Development CodeIgniter Auth Add-on
http://github.com/dflydev/dd-ci-ddauth


The ddauth add-on for CodeIgniter is intended to be a flexible authentication
library focussing almost entirely on the problem of creating a secure
authentication ticket and attempts to place as few restrictions as possible
on the application using it.

The primary purpose for writing this library was the fact that many of the
existing CodeIgniter authentication systems were either too complicated to
implement easily, required too much integration into the application itself
or focused solely on cookies and did not support fallback authentication
methods for when cookies are not available.

The latter is particularly important when using any sort of application with
a web application that requires authentication as Flash cannot be assumed to 
send the browser's cookies reliably. In this case, it is beneficial to be able
to pass the authentication ticket to the Flash movie and instruct it to pass
the ticket along as a GET or POST param.


The core security principles were inspired by the "Dos and Don'ts of Client
Authentication on the Web" document found here:
