ddauth - Dragonfly Development CodeIgniter Auth Add-on
http://code.google.com/p/dd-ci-ddauth

Copy the ddauth distribution files:

    cp dd-ci-ddauth/application/libraries/Ddauth.php \
        system/application/libraries/

    cp dd-ci-ddauth/application/config/dd_ci_ddauth.php \
        system/application/config/

It is recommended to update the 'ddauth_ticket_secret' configuration value in
the dd_ci_ddauth.php file located in path/to/your/system/application/config/.
Setting this value ensures that the authentication tickets generated by ddauth
are more secure.

Optionally add ddauth to application's autoload. To do so, modify
system/application/config/autoload.php to include the ddauth library:

    $autoload['libraries'] = array('Ddauth');
